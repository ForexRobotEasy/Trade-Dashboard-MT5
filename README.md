# Trade Dashboard MT5

This code represents a trade dashboard for MetaTrader 5 (MT5) platform. It provides various functions to manage risk, set reward-to-risk ratio, handle partial take profit or stop loss positions, set trailing stop options, and enable risk-free options for trades.

## Risk Management Function
The `manageRisk` function helps manage risk in trading by adjusting the position size based on the specified risk level. It calculates the position size by multiplying the account equity with the risk level.

## Reward-to-Risk Ratio Function
The `setRewardToRiskRatio` function sets the reward-to-risk ratio for trades. It calculates the target take profit and stop loss levels based on the specified reward and risk. The take profit level is calculated by multiplying the reward with the risk, and the stop loss level is set equal to the risk.

## Partial TP or SL Positions Function
The `setPartialPositions` function sets multiple partial take profit or stop loss positions for trades. It calculates the distance between each partial position based on the total position size and the specified number of positions. The position size is obtained from the current order lots, and the partial position distance is calculated by dividing the position size by the number of partial positions plus one.

## Trailing Stop Options Function
The `setTrailingStopOptions` function sets various trailing stop options for trades. It implements different trailing stop types based on the specified trailing stop type. The function includes code to set a fixed trailing stop, a dynamic trailing stop, and a percentage trailing stop. After setting the trailing stop, it applies it to the open trades.

## Risk-Free Options Function
The `enableRiskFreeOptions` function enables or disables risk-free options for trades. If risk-free options are enabled, the function modifies trades to protect the initial investment. The code inside the function implements the logic for risk-free options when enabled, and disables them when not enabled.

## Main Function
The `OnStart` function is the main function that executes the trade dashboard and user-friendly visualization. It also demonstrates the usage of the trading functions mentioned above. It sets the desired risk level, reward-to-risk ratio, number of partial positions, trailing stop type, and whether to enable or disable risk-free options. After setting the parameters, it executes trades based on the specified trading functions.
